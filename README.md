# Elm typing game

This is an elm app I wrote trains your ability to Type Tibetan. It was inspired
by a [similar project](https://github.com/hoelzro/elm-typing-tutor) for Russian,
but designed from scratch.

While it is not the first such program, it has a far more modern design than a
[2013 implementation](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6743395/?reload=true)
using flash.

It is a work in progress, so it may have flaws in both the
sample sentences and implementation. Feel free to open up a pull request if
you find something!

## Use
